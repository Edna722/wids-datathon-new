# WIDS Hackathon

* The WiDS Datathon was developed with Ann S. Bowers Women’s Brain Health Initiative (WBHI) in collaboration with Cornell University and UC Santa Barbara. Datasets and support are provided by the Healthy Brain Network (HBN), the signature scientific initiative of the Child Mind Institute, and the Reproducible Brain Charts Project (RBC).

* We will analyze diagnostic data, socio-demographic, emotional, and parenting data, and functional MRI data from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) — the signature scientific initiative of the Child Mind Institute.
* HBN utilizes a community-referred recruitment model by encouraging the participation of families who have concerns about mental health or learning challenges in their children.
* The functional MRI data are used to extract a time series of activity per brain region, and these regions’ time series are correlated to obtain functional MRI connectome matrices.

* The goal is to build a model to predict both an individual’s sex and their ADHD diagnosis using functional brain imaging data of children and adolescents and their socio-demographics, emotions, and parenting information.
